  \frametitle{Problems version control solves}
  \textbf{\large Why should I care?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Systematic and controlled \textbf{Backup}
  \item \textbf{Collaborate}: work on same document simultaneously
  \item Keep track of changes (who introduced feature X and why?)
  \item \textbf{Try out changes} and \textbf{revert} to working version (``undo''-button)
  \item Work on project on \textbf{different machines}
  \item Simplifies \textbf{bughunting}
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{2ex}
  \textbf{\large What's the catch?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Have to learn a few commands to interact with git
    \item Have to be organised
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Applications}
  \textbf{\large Version control can be be applied to:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Source code} (matlab, Fortran, C, Python, \dots)
  \item \textbf{LaTeX} (your thesis!)
  \item Results
  \item \textbf{Any text files}\footnotemark
  \end{itemize}
  \footnotetext{Binary files work as well, but harder to track changes}
